Pop Quiz (name subject to change)

Accomplished this week:
This week we continued to work with the Spotify API with varying levels of success. We are able to individually import songs to test the gameplay with, but taking the game to the next step and using authorization tokens to import more than one song at a time has been giving us some issues.

Challenges faced:
We are still trying to connect our client side game and our server side service where we will authorize the Spotify API and then import a playlist that we will use to run the game. We are going to see if an TAs have more experience with the Spotify API and the authorization setup so that we can move on and make more progress next week. Specifically, we will look into hosting a server on heroku to be able to make interactions with the API possible.

Goals for next week:
To continue to work on this connection and the authorization setup so we can look into game mechanics, scoring, and UX. Specifically, we would like to build a template for the game page so that the songs can be populated easily during gameplay and make the transitions between current songs seamless. We are also looking into changing the name of our game to something more creative, since some of our main feedback was that it was too cheesy (thanks Ming).
