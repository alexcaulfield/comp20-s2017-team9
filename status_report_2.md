Pop Quiz (name subject to change)

Accomplished this week:
This week we continued to work with the Spotify API with varying levels of success. As of now, we are able to individually import songs to test the gameplay with. We have just updated so that we can get an access token, and now we would like to import more than one song at a time and gather audio features of the song. Ming, you have been added as a collaborator to https://pop-quiz-dj.herokuapp.com, where we hold our server side code.

Challenges faced:
We are still trying to fully connect our client side game and our server side service where we will authorize the Spotify API and then import a playlist that we will use to run the game. It was difficult to begin this process but the use of a node js wrapper was helpful in facilitating the connection.

Goals for next week:
We would like to build a template for the game page so that the songs can be populated easily during gameplay and make the transitions between current songs seamless. Also, we would like to make use of the access token to get songs from a public playlist and gather audio features information to then test our algorithm on. We are also looking into changing the name of our game to something more creative, since some of our main feedback was that it was too cheesy (thanks Ming).
