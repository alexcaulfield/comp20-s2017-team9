Status Report as of 4/21/17:
Pop Quiz (name subject to change)

Accomplished this week:
Basic gameplay has been developed. Users can now select a song and it will display as their choice. Once 5 songs have been added to the playlist, the score that has been calculated as they make each choice is displayed as an alert and the user is redirected to the scoreboard page.

Challenges faced:
Callback functions and bad request errors have plagued our process of getting information on the songs. Managing the asynchronous nature of javascript has also been a challenge and has subsequently affected the readability of our code.

Goals for next week:
Connect the scoring to a database so that users can post their username and scores from the game. Secondly, we would like to connect our game to a spotify playlist with significantly more songs on it, and ones of similar genre so that scores could be better and gameplay would improve with a variety of songs. We also are looking to clean up the appearence and design of the game to make it look user friendly.

* "We would like to build a template for the game page so that the songs can be populated easily during gameplay and make the transitions between current songs seamless." => was this done?
