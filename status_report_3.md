Status Report as of 4/21/17:
Pop Quiz (name subject to change)

Accomplished this week:
Basic gameplay has been developed. Users can now select a song and it will display as their choice. Once they have selected 5 songs, the score that has been calculated as they make each choice is displayed as an alert.

Challenges faced:
Callback functions and bad request errors have plagued our process of getting information on the songs.

Goals for next week:
Connect the scoring to a database so that users can post their username and scores from the game. Secondly, we would like to connect our game to a spotify playlist with significantly more songs on it, and ones of similar genre so that scores could be better and gameplay would improve with a variety of songs.
