Progress Report as of 4/14/17:
Pop Quiz (name subject to change)

This week we continued to work with the Spotify API with varying levels of success. We are able to individually import songs to test the gameplay with, but taking the game to the next step and using authorization tokens to import more than one song at a time has been giving us some issues.

We are still trying to connect our client side game and our server side service where we will authorize the Spotify API and then import a playlist that we will use to run the game. We need to continue to work on this connection and the authorization setup before we can look into game mechanics, scoring, and UX. We are going to see if an TAs have more experience with the Spotify API and the authorization setup so that we can move on and make more progress next week. 
We are also looking into changing the name of our game to something more creative.
