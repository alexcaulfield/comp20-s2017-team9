# Group project idea

## DJ game idea:
* multiple-choice, you choose the next song - free spotify 30 second snippets
* get points for choosing songs that are related (spotify API - dancability, excitement, tempo)
* show different crowd responses with gifs for good, okay and poor choices
* save high scores server-side 
* have a total of like 100 songs, people can start with a choice of 10 and then feed them similar genre songs in the multiple-choice
* can have transitions between genres - ex: Uma Thurman by Fall Out Boy is Pop/Rock/Electronic so multiple choice would include songs of all those genres

## technologies:
front-end framework - use React for both mobile and desktop
(javascript framework?/RESTful)
server-side persistance - hold high scores
geolocation to show the closest venues you could be playing at and show a picture?
