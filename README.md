# TEAM 9 - DJ Game Idea

### Project title

### Problem Statement
People don't know how to choose the next song in a playlist.

### How do you solve the problem?
Have an interactive game that gives people more points for choosing songs that are similar to each other in a sequence.

### List of all the features that your team will implement
#### Features of game
* have a total of like 100 songs, people can start with a choice of 10 and then feed them similar genre songs in the multiple-choice
* multiple-choice, you choose the next song - free spotify 30 second snippets
* get points for choosing songs that are related (spotify API - dancability, excitement, tempo)
* show different crowd responses with gifs for good, okay and poor choices
* can have transitions between genres - ex: Uma Thurman by Fall Out Boy is Pop/Rock/Electronic so multiple choice would include songs of all those genres

#### Pick 3
* front-end framework - use React for both mobile and desktop
* server-side persistance - hold high scores (firebase)
* geolocation to show the closest venues you could be playing at and show a picture? or client-side persistance for high scores

### What data will your prototype be using and collecting
* scores
* song data

### Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary
* calculating scores for each choice of next song
